# Fancy

This mod is a custom cosmetic loader- it loads bundles of custom cosmetics to let you use them ingame! **This mod does
not contain any custom cosmetics itself.** If you'd like a bundle to get started, check out [ImmortalChickens' cosmetics 
bundle](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/ImmortalChickens/Straftat_Cosmetics_Bundle_IC/)!

## Usage

- Install the mod
- Place cosmetic bundles (.cbundle files) anywhere in your plugins folder (mod managers will do this for you if you
install mods with cosmetic bundles in them.)
- **Make sure you and anyone you play with have the same bundles installed. Weird things may happen if you don't!**
- Profit

## Some Notes

- The mod will write a "cosmetics code" to your log when you start the game - this is a unique code that corresponds to 
the bundles you have installed. It can be used to quickly and easily check everyone you're playing with has the same
bundles - just send your code and check that your opponents' codes match!
- If you're installing bundles manually, i'd strongly recommend using the `CosmeticBundles` directory the mod generates
in your plugins folder to keep things neat.

## Creating Bundles

- To create bundles, you'll need to install unity and use the fancy editor toolkit to build cosmetics into a bundle
- You can download the editor tools at [the GitHub repo's releases page](https://github.com/kestrel-straftat/fancy/releases/latest)
- Some instructions to get started are included in the toolkit, and a video guide is also in the works.

## Manual Installation Instructions

_**(you should probably just use a mod manager like [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/ebkr/r2modman/) or [gale](https://thunderstore.io/c/straftat/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/) though)**_

- Download and install [Bepinex 5.4.21](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) <br><small>(if you have no idea what the versions mean try BepInEx_x64_5.4.21.0 and it might work. maybe)</small>
- Once BepInEx is installed, extract the zip into the BepInEx/plugins folder in the game's root directory.

have fun :3
